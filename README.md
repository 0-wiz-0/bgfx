Building
--------

### Prerequsites

Premake 4.4 beta4
[http://industriousone.com/premake/download](http://industriousone.com/premake/download)

GNU make. Windows users download GNU make utility from:
[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

### Getting source

	git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bx.git
	git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.git
	cd bgfx
	make

After calling make, .build/projects/* directory will be generated. All
intermediate files generated by compiler will be inside .build directory
structure. Deleting .build directory at any time is safe.

### Building for Windows

When building on Windows, you have to set DXSDK_DIR environment variable to
point to DirectX SDK directory.

	setx DXSDK_DIR <path to DirectX SDK directory>

If you're building with MinGW/TDM compiler on Windows make DirectX SDK
directory link to directory without spaces in the path.

	mklink /D <path to DirectX SDK directory> c:\dxsdk
	setx DXSDK_DIR c:\dxsdk

### Building for Native Client (Pepper 22) on Windows

Download Native Client SDK from
[https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/download](https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/download)

	setx NACL_DIR <path to Native Client SDK directory>

### Building

Visual Studio 2008:

	start .build/projects/vs2008/bgfx.sln

Linux 64-bit:

	make -R linux-release64

Other platforms:

	make -R <configuration>

Configuration is <platform>-<debug/release><32/64>. For example:

	linux-release32, nacl-debug64, android-release32, etc.

Examples
--------

### 00-helloworld

### 02-metaballs
Rendering with transient buffers.

### 03-raymarch
